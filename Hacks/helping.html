            <li>But if we really want to improve life prospects for poor kids we need to reduce the number of poor kids. Which means increasing their families’ incomes.</li> <br>
            <li>Undocumented workers face limited employment options and are easily exploited by employers. Their families are thus more likely to be poor. This is why we need to put immigration reform into place </li> <br>
            <li>People living in low-income neighborhoods pay extra for most everything, from food to car loans, and are dependent upon high-interest “pay-day loans” because many banks won’t serve poor neighborhoods. </li>  <br>
